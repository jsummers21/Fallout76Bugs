# Fallout76 Bugs
Motors dissapearing during "Early Warnings" quest:
Black box testing could be used to find this bug. Having someone playtest all the quests to make sure they are all able to be completed would make it so any errors when the quest is being done. It can also show if the bug is the quest itself or some other feature of the game causing it.

Fallout 76 won't run:
Whitebox testing could be used to find the bug. Compatability testing will have the tester try running the game on different platforms to make sure it works on them as well as different hardwares to create minimum requirements to play the game. 

Unavailable NPC during "Personal Matters" quest:
This bug could be found while black box smoke testing the quest. If players run through the quest multiple times, it would be easy to figure out the NPC that is required during the quest is not there at some point. Automated Testing could also work if it is tested multiple times to make sure the NPC spawns correctly.

Carry weight decreasing:
White box functional testing would find the bug. Testing each feature of the game making sure it works correctly would help find the bug. For carry weight, continuously putting items in the players inventory would help find this bug because it can test if it is a problem with the items in the inventory or the inventory itself.

Fallout 76 crashing after leaving vault 76:
White box regression testing would find the bug. Regression testing would test older versions of the game to see if it is a problem in a previous version or the newer version of the game. If the game still continues to crash in the older version it means there is a bug in the code howver if it doesn't crash in the older version, the bug is still there however it can be easily found what caused the difference in the newer version of the game.
