# Fallout76 Bugs
Motors dissapearing during "Early Warnings" quest:
Black box testing could be used to find this bug. Having someone playtest all the quests to make sure they are all able to be completed would make it so any errors when the quest is being done. It can also show if the bug is the quest itself or some other feature of the game causing it.

Fallout 76 won't run:
Whitebox testing could be used to find the bug. Compatability testing will have the tester try running the game on different platforms to make sure it works on them as well as different hardwares to create minimum requirements to play the game. 

Unavailable NPC during "Personal Matters" quest:
This bug could be found while black box smoke testing the quest. If players run through the quest multiple times, it would be easy to figure out the NPC that is required during the quest is not there at some point. Automated Testing could also work if it is tested multiple times to make sure the NPC spawns correctly.
